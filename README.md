# Household Energy Optimization

This project involved analyzing, predicting, and optimizing household energy consumption using over two million observations of various metrics of power consumption over roughly 4 years.
After preprocessing, scaling, and normalizing the data, I created a sequential neural network to analyze the consumption data and predict energy usage, and using various techniques analyzed feature importance
and was able to leverage the neural network to optimize household energy consumption by analyzing which factors had the biggest influence on energy consumption and how to curb them.
